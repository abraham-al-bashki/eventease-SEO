# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

# Login

To "login" you will have to be in the homepage to see the login button. Click on the button and type in the username (the password part will come later when the login framework is more robust).

The current usernames are guest, kalle, anki, rik and ardo. If the username changed for some reason, then you could still look for them in GuestLoginPopUp.vue.
